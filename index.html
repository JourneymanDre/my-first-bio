      <h3>
        Army Career
        
      </h3>
        <p>
          I served four and a half years in the British Army and during that time I served 18 months in Northern Ireland. <br>
          Upon my return to mainland England, I started my preparation for my next deployment which would've been Iraq in 2007 but it wasn't to be because I was at the end of my term so I opted terminate my contract and moved on to civilian life.

           Life in the U.S.A so far
           
           </h4>
            <p>
              So far things have been great,I landed in Houston Texas in March 2018,l
              ived there for one year then relocated to Dallas Texas. 
              The people here are welcoming and I must admit that I feel at home in this city. 
              There's still a few things that will take some getting used to i.e driving everywhere,the health system just to name a few.
